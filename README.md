# Essence Of India

A collaborative effort to curate a website for the promotion of homestays and adding socio-cultural richness to any tourist's trip in India.

## What are homestays?

Homestay is an accommodation where you stay with a local family. Rather than living in a hotel with its commercial offerings, you live as a temporary tenant in an already settled familyâ€™s home.

## Our goal

We aim to build a boomer-friendly web interface such that the homestay ecosystem in India flourishes; thereby improving the overall tourism experience of the travelers.

### Highlights:

- **Promotion of Indian culture:** We will facilitate the promotion of Homestays and show how they can be a much better choice for travelers to get the most out of their trip.
- **Regulating the homestay ecosystem:** We will display all important information about the Homestay which will include details like: USP of that home stay, VR experience of the place, availability of separate room or option for living with the family.
- **Personalise the experience:** The user will get suggestions based on the reviews from previous searches on the website and will get location recommendations.
